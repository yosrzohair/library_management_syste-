### **Task: Build a Simple Library Management System**


#### **Objective**


Create a Python program that models a library system with the following features:


1. **Books** can be added, borrowed, or returned.

2. Different types of books (e.g., fiction, non-fiction) with additional attributes.

3. Track the borrowing status of each book.


---


1. **Classes and Objects**

   Model books and the library as classes with attributes and methods.

2. **Encapsulation**

   Use private attributes to store the book's borrowing status and provide getter/setter methods.

3. **Inheritance**

   Create subclasses for different types of books (e.g., Fiction and NonFiction) that extend the Book class.

4. **Polymorphism**

   Implement methods like get_info() that behave differently based on the book type.
